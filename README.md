This is my Optimized user.cfg for Star Citizen 3.22.0-Live 9003408 running pretty smooth with rather okay graphics on a Intel i7-6800k 32Gig ram and a GTX 1080.

This user.cfg increased my fps by 20+ and still keeps the good visuals within the game,
There are some issues with it though:
1. The Lightning takes some time to actually take it's "form" in darker areas might be an eyeaddaption thingy, its like it slowly loads in
and sometimes there are bright spots/areas where the lights should not really be at the first place(missplacement of light sources maybe?)
2. There is some issues for me when you are close to planets and the thrusters on the ship starts to pick up dust clouds and that causes massive fps drops/stuutters, its manageable but it would suck dick mining i belive.
i have yet to try out ground vehicles if they causes lag aswell but i belive they dont or atleast not in the same sence as a A2 hercules.

Here are some example screenshots :

And this is the most stressfull area in loreville i've found so far.

And Credit for Isaard and his config, without it i would not have dived down this rabbit hole and made my own.
